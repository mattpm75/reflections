How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

The plusses and minuses made the changes between the files very easy to identify

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Rabbit holes can be virtually never ending. Being able to step back and restore previous versions makes exploration less scary

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

A pro is allowing the user to decide when to commit. A con is that it relies on proactivity by the user.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

I think it is based on the purpose or scope of the version control system being used.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

These will view the commits or compare different versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You can always revert to an earlier version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Not sure yet.
